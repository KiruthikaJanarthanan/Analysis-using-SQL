# Analysis-using-SQL
Over the course of our queries, we explored various financial insights, focusing on interest calculations, customer transactions, and account balances.
## **Project Overview**

This project involves querying and analyzing a **bank database** using **SQL in MySQL Workbench**. The goal is to extract key financial insights regarding **customer accounts, transactions, interest earnings, and banking trends**.

## **Tools Used**

- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** for querying and analysis.
- **Database Tables:** `bank_customer`, `bank_account_details`, `bank_account_transaction`, `bank_interest_rate`, etc.

## **Key Areas of Analysis**

1. **Customer Accounts & Transactions**

- Identifying high-net-worth customers based on total account balances.
- Analyzing inactive savings accounts that still accrue interest.
- Tracking holiday and non-holiday transactions for customer engagement.
- Examining Friday vs. non-Friday spending behavior.

2. **Regional & Transactional Channel Breakdown**

- State-wise accrued interest earnings and total transaction amounts.
- Transaction analysis by channel (POS, ATM, Net Banking, UPI) to identify trends.
- High-value transactions flagged for risk and fraud detection.

3. **Account Types, Interest Payables & Receivables**

- Calculating accrued interest for **recurring deposits, savings accounts, and credit cards**.
- Comparing **bank's interest liabilities (on deposits) vs. revenue (from loans & credit cards).**
- Identifying customers with **highest interest earnings** for premium banking services.

## **Key Business Insights & Recommendations**

- **Optimize interest strategies** to balance interest income and payouts.
- **Leverage spending trends** (e.g., holiday and weekend spending) for targeted promotions.
- **Enhance fraud detection** by monitoring high-value transactions.
